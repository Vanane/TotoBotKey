# TotoBotKey
## Just like AutoHotKey !*
*with a $0 budget and 8 hours of work

## What is this ?
A scripting macro tool written in Python, mainly destined to Wayland (but it might work with Xorg too, ig ?).
The inputs are simulated using [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool), whereas the events are managed simply by reading udev's input files.

It work not unsimilarly to AutoHotKey, which I've yet to find a satisfying replacement on Linux, and more specifically on Wayland.

## Why tho ?
I've yet to find a satisfying replacement on Linux, and more specifically on Wayland.
Apparently, KDE's macro tool is complete enough to do most stuff, but I believe that a single script ~~to rule them all~~ that handles everything feels easier to use and manage. Also, versioningâ„¢-capable !

## What do I need ?
- A computer and an OS that uses Wayland
- Python 3.9+
- [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool), which also includes ydotoold

**Quick note on ydotoold :** (I AM NOT A SYSADMIN, DON'T TAKE THIS AS A GOOD SECURITY MEASURE)<br>
It is recommended to run it as root user, but by doing so, ydotoold will create a socket file that's unreadable by a normal user.

The way _I_ am running ydotoold right now is the following :
- A Bash script starts the service and `chmod 660 & chgrp input`s the socket file it creates
- The user I'm logged in is added to that `input` group, and this line : `export YDOTOOL_SOCKET=/tmp/.ydotool_socket` is present in its `.bashrc`
- A systemd service runs that Bash script

## To-do List
By order of priority :
- Refactor and clean codebase (lmao)
- Add support for each ydotool command options (delaying keys, sending keydown/up, etc.)
- Add keydown/keyup events
- Encapsulate decorations into a class
- Better handling of keyboard layout
  - Current solution : "you figure out your own keys dictionary"
- Add a screenshot function (or a library that does just that on Wayland)
